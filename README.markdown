C+SDL+Cairo, animated "Meteor" demos.

http://github.com/acdimalev/acdimalev-demo-2010-05-01-01

You must have Cairo and SDL installed to build these demos.

* http://cairographics.org
* http://www.libsdl.org

These demos were developed on a Debian Lenny system with the following dev packages installed:

* libcairo2-dev=1.6.4-7
* libsdl1.2-dev=1.2.13-2

To build and execute the demos, run "make" and then run either demo binary.

    $ make
    $ ./demo-1
    $ ./demo-2

Each demo will pop up in a window, and may be closed with the *q* key.

* Q &mdash; quit
* SPACE &mdash; action
